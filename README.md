## Description 

This is based on the Coursera Project Course Work, "Build a Python GUI with Tkinter" (Please enroll to this course by visiting this [link](https://www.coursera.org/projects/build-a-python-gui-with-tkinter) ). This course demonstrates how to create a visual interface using Python and determine the correlation between temperature and rain, and birth of month and number of births. <br>

Tkinter application inherits from Frame to create the Graphical User Interface (GUI) Window. It is a container widget that groups and organizes other wides within a GUI. The purpose of it is to create visual structure and layot, separate different sections of the interface, manage complex layouts more effectively. In practical ways, we can group the following: 
* Related widgets (buttons, labels, entry fields, etc.),
* Create tabbed interfaces with multiple frames
* Implement master-detail views.

## Implementation
