>Please ensure that you have the latest version of Python. If not, then please download [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

>Ensure you have all the following modules or sub-modules (Some of them require manual installation):
>tkinter, plotdata, stats, matplotlib, regression plot, seaborn, pandas, pylot.
>After installing Python, open your terminal or cmd, type this command: pip install "module" (Replace the module with the above. Note that not every one of them is a module). 

## Description 

This is based on the Coursera Project Course Work, "Build a Python GUI with Tkinter" (Please enroll to this course by visiting this [link](https://www.coursera.org/projects/build-a-python-gui-with-tkinter) ). This course demonstrates how to create a visual interface using Python and determine the correlation between temperature and rain, and birth of month and number of births. <br>

Tkinter application inherits from Frame to create the Graphical User Interface (GUI) Window. It is a container widget that groups and organizes other wides within a GUI. The purpose of it is to create visual structure and layot, separate different sections of the interface, manage complex layouts more effectively. In practical ways, we can group the following: 
* Related widgets (buttons, labels, entry fields, etc.),
* Create tabbed interfaces with multiple frames
* Implement master-detail views.

## Implementation

1. Download this repository.
2. Run dataview.py using Visual Studio Code or Python latest version.
3. The interface will prompt you options to type the name of the file, determine the X Label and Y Label, or quit.
4. The following are the correlation between the birth months and the number of births.

5. The following are the correlation between the temperature and rain.

6. You can also downlaod the figures, adjust the size, and zoom the figures.

## Future Works
* More math formula samples.
* Many formats (not just csv).
* Using "input" to allow users choose the files regardless of the location path.
